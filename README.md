    Welcome to ETHMask!!

    This command line interface allows you to mix Ethereum transactions.

    Here's a quick guide on how to use it:

    Enter your private key and wallet address and Infura API key into the .env file.
    This wallet address and private key in .env are used to send the payments to the new generated addresses by ETHMix.

    You have options to enter a custom RPC endpoint and proxy, but these are not required options as the default will use Infura set in the .env         file.

    rpc <RPC_endpoint>: This command sets the RPC endpoint (Not required by default).
                         For example, 'rpc https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR-PROJECT-ID' will set the RPC endpoint to the provided Infura address.

    proxy <Proxy_URL>: This command sets the Proxy URL (Not required by default).
                       For example, 'proxy http://127.0.0.1:9050' will set the Proxy URL to a local Tor proxy.

    new_accounts <number>: This command generates a number of new Ethereum accounts.
                            For example, 'new_accounts 100' will create 100 new accounts.

    send_transactions: This command prompts you to select a CSV file with account details, then sends transactions to those accounts.

    For more information about a command, type 'help <command>'.
    For example, 'help new_accounts' will display more information about the 'new_accounts' command.

ETHMask is a command-line interface (CLI) tool for mixing Ethereum transactions.

## Overview

ETHMask provides a simple and secure way to mix Ethereum transactions, allowing users to enhance their transaction privacy. It generates new Ethereum accounts and sends transactions to those accounts, making it difficult to trace the original sender.

## Features

- Create new Ethereum accounts securely
- Send transactions to the generated accounts
- Customizable transaction amount based on percentage or custom value
- Integration with Infura for RPC endpoint
- Support for proxy configuration
- Consolidation script to further enhance privacy

## Prerequisites

Before using ETHMask, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.7 or higher installed
- Ethereum wallet addresses and their corresponding private keys stored in a CSV file
- Infura API key (sign up at [https://infura.io/](https://infura.io/))
- Etherscan API key (sign up at [https://etherscan.io/](https://etherscan.io/))

## Installation

1. Clone the ETHMask repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ETHMask.git

Change into the project directory:

cd ETHMask

Install the required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Create a .env file and add the following variables:

PRIVATE_KEY=<your-private-key>
MY_ADDRESS=<your-wallet-address>
INFURA_API_KEY=<your-infura-api-key>
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=<your-etherscan-api-key>

Run ETHMask:

python ETHMask.py

Follow the prompts to execute the desired commands:
rpc <RPC_endpoint>: Set the RPC endpoint for Ethereum network connection.
proxy <Proxy_URL>: Set the Proxy URL for network connection (optional).
new_accounts <number>: Generate a specified number of new Ethereum accounts.
send_transactions: Send transactions to the generated accounts.

Examples

Generate 100 new Ethereum accounts:
new_accounts 100

Send transactions to the accounts:
send_transactions

# ETHSweeper After Stage 1

ETHSweeper is a script that automates the process of sweeping small amounts of Ethereum.
(ETH) from multiple addresses into a single "master" address.

## Overview

ETHSweeper reads from a CSV file containing Ethereum addresses and their private keys. It checks the balance of each address and, if the balance is sufficient to cover the gas fee for a transaction, it sends the balance (minus the gas fee) to the master address specified by the user.

The gas price is fetched from the Ethereum network at the time of each transaction, ensuring that the script always uses the current gas price.

## Features

- Sweep ETH from multiple addresses to a master address
- Dynamic gas price retrieval
- Support for multiple CSV files
- Calculation of ETH to USD conversion rate

How to Use:

The ETH Sweeper requires the same env file as ETHMixer.

Start the Ethereum Sweeper by running the script with a Python interpreter. The CLI will provide you with the following commands:

sweep: Sweeps all the Ethereum from addresses listed in a selected CSV file into a single "master" address.

exit: Exits the program.

## How It Works:
The sweep command prompts you for the master address, lists all CSV files in the ./Accounts directory, and asks you to select one. For each address, the command checks the balance. If it is sufficient to cover the gas fee, the command sends the balance (minus the gas fee) to the master address.

## Additional Information:
The Ethereum Sweeper is designed to run on Ethereum's Sepolia Testnet. Change the HTTP Provider URL in the Web3.HTTPProvider function if you want to use it on the Ethereum Mainnet or a different testnet.

Be cautious when entering the "master" Ethereum address as all the ETH from the other addresses will be transferred to it. Always double-check addresses before transferring funds and ensure that you never share your private keys.
